 * Represents tempo changes.  Tempo is kept for the whole
 * song, and is independent of tracks.  You may change the
 * tempo during a song.
 *
 * As of JFugue 4.0, Tempo represents the Beats Per Minute (BPM).
 * In previous versions, Tempo was measured in microseconds per beat,
 * which is how MIDI maintains this information.
 * (tempo = 60000 / BPM, and BPM = 60000 / tempo)
