     * with a duration of 'duration/numSteps'.  This means that if you're sliding from a F to a G,
     * for example, you could get music that looks like F F F F F F F F G G G G G G, with each note
     * having a very short duration.  The problem with this is that the sound of each note stopping and
     * starting again is noticeable.   A more intelligent implementation would sound each note for as
     * long as necessary, then sound a different note only when the microtonal math requires it.  Otherwise,
     * the pitch wheel messages should cause the note to change while it is playing.
     * This implementation may require one or more new methods in MicrotoneNotation.
