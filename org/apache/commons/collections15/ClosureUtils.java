/**
 * <code>ClosureUtils</code> provides reference implementations and utilities
 * for the Closure functor interface. The supplied closures are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Invoker - invokes a method on the input object
 * <li>For - repeatedly calls a closure for a fixed number of times
 * <li>While - repeatedly calls a closure while a predicate is true
 * <li>DoWhile - repeatedly calls a closure while a predicate is true
 * <li>Chained - chains two or more closures together
 * <li>Switch - calls one closure based on one or more predicates
 * <li>SwitchMap - calls one closure looked up from a Map
 * <li>Transformer - wraps a Transformer as a Closure
 * <li>NOP - does nothing
 * <li>Exception - always throws an exception
 * </ul>
 * All the supplied closures are Serializable.
