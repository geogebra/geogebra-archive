/**
 * 
 * InterfaceManager
 * 
 * This class is used to create SensorDataProducers.  The InterfaceManager
 * needs a DeviceFactory and a set of DeviceConfigs.  Probably the Interface
 * Manager will be create from a configuration that includes the device configs
 * and the configuration for the DeviceFactory.
 * 
 * The DeviceConfig objects map setup the different types of sensor devices
 * with any connection settings.  For example if it is a serial device then 
 * the serial port can be saved a connection setting.
 * 
 * The type of SensorDevice that is created to work with the SensorDataProducer
 * is determined by the list of DeviceConfig objects.  
 * - If there is no list then
 * each device from the DeviceFactory will be created and checked if it is
 * attached.  In this case some default connection settings will be used by the 
 * device.  
 * - If there is a list then
 * the first device on the list will be created and checked if it is attached,
 * then the second device, etc.    
 *
 * NOTES: Probably this should be turned into an interface or abstract class.  And
 * there should be a java and waba version of this class.  This could be used
 * to remove dependencies between the this package and the device package.
