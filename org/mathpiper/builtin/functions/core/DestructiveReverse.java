*CMD DestructiveReverse --- reverse a list destructively
*CORE
*CALL
	DestructiveReverse(list)

*PARMS

{list} -- list to reverse

*DESC

This command reverses "list" in place, so that the original is
destroyed. This means that any variable bound to "list" will now have
an undefined content, and should not be used any more.
The reversed list is returned.

Destructive commands are faster than their nondestructive
counterparts. {Reverse} is the non-destructive version of
this function.

*E.G.

	In> lst := {a,b,c,13,19};
	Out> {a,b,c,13,19};
	In> revlst := DestructiveReverse(lst);
	Out> {19,13,c,b,a};
	In> lst;
	Out> {a};
