*CMD XmlTokenizer --- select an XML syntax tokenizer for parsing the input
*CORE
*CALL
	XmlTokenizer()

*DESC

A "tokenizer" is an internal routine in the kernel that parses the input into MathPiper expressions.
This affects all input typed in by a user at the prompt and also the input redirected from files or strings using {FromFile} and {FromString} and read using {Read} or {ReadToken}.

The MathPiper environment currently supports some experimental tokenizers for
various syntaxes. {XmlTokenizer} switches to an XML syntax.
Note that setting the tokenizer is a global side effect.
One typically needs
to switch back to the default tokenizer when finished reading the special syntax.

Care needs to be taken when kernel errors are raised during a non-default tokenizer operation (as with any global change in the environment).
Errors need to be
caught with the {TrapError} function. The error handler code should re-instate
the default tokenizer,
or else the user will be unable to continue the session
(everything a user types will be parsed using a non-default tokenizer).

When reading XML syntax, the supported formats are the same as those of {XmlExplodeTag}.
The parser does not validate anything in the XML input.
After an XML token has been read in, it can be converted into an
MathPiper expression with {XmlExplodeTag}.
Note that when reading XML, any plain text between tags is returned as one token.
Any malformed XML will be treated as plain text.


**E.G. notest

	In> [XmlTokenizer(); q:=ReadToken(); \
	  DefaultTokenizer();q;]
	<a>Out> <a>;

Note that:
*	1. after switching to {XmlTokenizer} the {In>} prompt disappeared; the user typed {<a>} and the {Out>} prompt with the resulting expression appeared.
*	2. The resulting expression is an atom with the string representation {<a>};
it is <i>not</i> a string.
