*CMD Bind --- assignment
*CORE
*CALL
	Bind(var, exp)

*PARMS

{var} -- variable which should be assigned

{exp} -- expression to assign to the variable

*DESC

The expression "exp" is evaluated and assigned it to the variable
named "var". The first argument is not evaluated. The value True
is returned.

The statement {Bind(var, exp)} is equivalent to {var := exp}, but the {:=} operator
has more uses, e.g. changing individual entries in a list.

*E.G.

	In> Bind(a, Sin(x)+3);
	Out> True;
	In> a;
	Out> Sin(x)+3;
