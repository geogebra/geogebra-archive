*CMD Read --- read an expression from current input
*CORE
*CALL
	Read()

*DESC

Read an expression from the current input, and return it unevaluated. When
the end of an input file is encountered, the token atom {EndOfFile} is returned.

*E.G.

	In> PipeFromString("2+5;") Read();
	Result: 2+5;
	In> PipeFromString("") Read();
	Result: EndOfFile;
