*CMD Delete --- delete an element from a list
*CORE
*CALL
	Delete(list, n)

*PARMS

{list} -- list from which an element should be removed

{n} -- index of the element to remove

*DESC

This command deletes the n-th element from "list". The first
parameter should be a list, while "n" should be a positive integer
less than or equal to the length of "list". The entry with index
"n" is removed (the first entry has index 1), and the resulting list
is returned.

*E.G.

	In> Delete({a,b,c,d,e,f}, 4);
	Out> {a,b,c,e,f};
