{n} -- integer, new value of precision

*DESC

This command sets the number of decimal digits to be used in calculations.
All subsequent floating point operations will allow for
at least {n} digits of mantissa.

This is not the number of digits after the decimal point.
For example, {123.456} has 3 digits after the decimal point and 6 digits of mantissa.
The number {123.456} is adequately computed by specifying {BuiltinPrecisionSet(6)}.

The call {BuiltinPrecisionSet(n)} will not guarantee that all results are precise to {n} digits.

When the precision is changed, all variables containing previously calculated values
remain unchanged.
The {BuiltinPrecisionSet} function only makes all further calculations proceed with a different precision.

Also, when typing floating-point numbers, the current value of {BuiltinPrecisionSet} is used to implicitly determine the number of precise digits in the number.

*E.G.

	In> BuiltinPrecisionSet(10)
	Out> True;
	In> N(Sin(1))
	Out> 0.8414709848;
	In> BuiltinPrecisionSet(20)
	Out> True;
	In> x:=N(Sin(1))
	Out> 0.84147098480789650665;

The value {x} is not changed by a {BuiltinPrecisionSet()} call:

	In> [ BuiltinPrecisionSet(10); x; ]
	Out> 0.84147098480789650665;

The value {x} is rounded off to 10 digits after an arithmetic operation:

	In> x+0.
	Out> 0.8414709848;

In the above operation, {0.} was interpreted as a number which is precise to 10 digits (the user does not need to type {0.0000000000} for this to happen).
So the result of {x+0.} is precise only to 10 digits.
