*CMD Time --- measure the time taken by an evaluation
*CORE
*CALL
	Time() expr
*PARMS
{expr} -- any expression
*DESC
The function {Time() expr} evaluates the expression {expr} and returns the time needed for the evaluation.
The result is returned as a floating-point number of seconds.
The value of the expression {expr} is lost.

The result is the "user time" as reported by the OS, not the real ("wall clock") time.
Therefore, any CPU-intensive processes running alongside MathPiper will not significantly affect the result of {Time}.

*E.G.
	In> Time() Simplify((a*b)/(b*a))
	Out> 0.09;

*SEE EchoTime, SystemTimer
