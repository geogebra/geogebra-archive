*CMD Replace --- replace an entry in a list

*CORE

*CALL
	Replace(list, n, expr)

*PARMS

{list} -- list of which an entry should be replaced

{n} -- index of entry to replace

{expr} -- expression to replace the n-th entry with

*DESC

The n-th entry of "list" is replaced by the expression
"expr". This is equivalent to calling {Delete} and
{Insert} in sequence. To be precise, the expression
{Replace(list, n, expr)} has the same result as the
expression {Insert(Delete(list, n), n, expr)}.

*E.G.

	In> Replace({a,b,c,d,e,f}, 4, x);
	Out> {a,b,c,x,e,f};

*SEE Delete, Insert, DestructiveReplace
