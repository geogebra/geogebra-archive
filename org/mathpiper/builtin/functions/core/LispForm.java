*CMD LispForm --- print an expression in LISP-format

*CALL
	LispForm(expr)

*PARMS

{expr} -- expression to be printed in LISP-format

*DESC

Evaluates "expr", and prints it in LISP-format on the current
output. It is followed by a newline. The evaluated expression is also
returned.

This can be useful if you want to study the internal representation of
a certain expression.

*E.G. notest

	In> LispForm(a+b+c);
	(+ (+ a b )c )
	Out> a+b+c;
	In> LispForm(2*I*b^2);
	(* (Complex 0 2 )(^ b 2 ))
	Out> Complex(0,2)*b^2;

The first example shows how the expression {a+b+c} is
internally represented. In the second example, {2*I} is
first evaluated to {Complex(0,2)} before the expression
is printed.
