*CMD Subst --- perform a substitution
*CORE
*CALL
	Subst(from, to) expr

*PARMS

{from} -- expression to be substituted

{to} -- expression to substitute for "from"

{expr} -- expression in which the substitution takes place

*DESC

This function substitutes every occurrence of "from" in "expr" by
"to". This is a syntactical substitution: only places where "from"
occurs as a subexpression are affected.

*E.G.

	In> Subst(x, Sin(y)) x^2+x+1;
	Out> Sin(y)^2+Sin(y)+1;
	In> Subst(a+b, x) a+b+c;
	Out> x+c;
	In> Subst(b+c, x) a+b+c;
	Out> a+b+c;

The explanation for the last result is that the expression {a+b+c} is internally stored as {(a+b)+c}. Hence {a+b} is a subexpression, but {b+c} is not.
