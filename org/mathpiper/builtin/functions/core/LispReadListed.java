*CMD LispReadListed --- read expressions in LISP syntax
*CORE
*CALL
	LispReadListed()

*DESC

The function {LispReadListed} reads a LISP expression and returns
it in a list, instead of the form usual to MathPiper (expressions).
The result can be thought of as applying {FunctionToList} to {LispRead}.
The function {LispReadListed} is more useful for reading arbitrary LISP expressions, because the
first object in a list can be itself a list (this is never the case for MathPiper expressions where the first object in a list is always a function atom).

*E.G. notest

	In> FromString("(+ a b)")LispReadListed()
	Out> {+,a,b};
