*CMD Continue --- skips executing the remainder of code in this loop iteration and begins the next iteration
*CORE
*CALL

    Continue()

*DESC

If Break is executed inside of a While, Until, For, or ForEach loop, all the code between
the continue command and the end of the loop will be skipped and the next loop iteration
will be started.

*E.G.

/%mathpiper

x := 1;

While(x <= 10)
[
    Echo(x);

    If(x = 5, Break());

    x++;
];

/%/mathpiper

    /%output,preserve="false"
      Result: True
