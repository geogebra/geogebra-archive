*CMD Eval --- force evaluation of expression
*CORE
*CALL
	Eval(expr)

*PARMS

{expr} -- expression to evaluate

*DESC

This function explicitly requests an evaluation of the expression
"expr", and returns the result of this evaluation.

*E.G.

	In> a := x;
	Out> x;
	In> x := 5;
	Out> 5;
	In> a;
	Out> x;
	In> Eval(a);
	Out> 5;

The variable {a} is bound to {x},
and {x} is bound to 5. Hence evaluating {a} will give {x}. Only when an extra
evaluation of {a} is requested, the value 5 is
returned.

Note that the behavior would be different if we had exchanged the
assignments. If the assignment {a := x} were given
while {x} had the value 5, the variable {a} would also get the value 5 because the assignment
operator {:=} evaluates the right-hand side.
