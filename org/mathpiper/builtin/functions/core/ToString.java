*CMD ToString --- connect current output to a string
*CORE
*CALL
	ToString() body

*PARMS

{body} -- expression to be evaluated

*DESC

The commands in "body" are executed. Everything that is printed on
the current output, by {Echo} for instance, is
collected in a string and this string is returned.

*E.G.

	In> str := ToString() [ WriteString(  \
	  "The square of 8 is "); Write(8^2); ];
	Out> "The square of 8 is  64";
