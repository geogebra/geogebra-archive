*CMD ReturnFromBlock --- returns from a code block
*CORE
*CALL

    ReturnFromBlock(value)

*DESC

If ReturnFromBlock is executed inside of a code block, the code block will immediately
return and {value} will be the result that is returned from the code block.  ReturnFromBlock
can be used to return from a function if the function uses a code
block to enclose the expressions which implement it.

*E.G.

/%mathpiper

TestFunction() :=
[
    Echo("1");

    If(True, ReturnFromBlock(3));

    Echo("2");
];


TestFunction();

/%/mathpiper

    /%output,preserve="false"
      Result: 3
