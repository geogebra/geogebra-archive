*CMD DestructiveInsert --- insert an element destructively into a list
*CORE
*CALL
	DestructiveInsert(list, n, expr)

*PARMS

{list} -- list in which "expr" should be inserted

{n} -- index at which to insert

{expr} -- expression to insert in "list"

*DESC

This is the destructive counterpart of {Insert}. This
command yields the same result as the corresponding call to
{Insert}, but the original list is modified. So if a
variable is bound to "list", it will now be bound to the list with
the expression "expr" inserted.

Destructive commands run faster than their nondestructive counterparts
because the latter copy the list before they alter it.

*E.G.

	In> lst := {a,b,c,d};
	Result: {a,b,c,d};
	In> Insert(lst, 2, x);
	Result: {a,x,b,c,d};
	In> lst;
	Result: {a,b,c,d};
	In> DestructiveInsert(lst, 2, x);
	Result: {a,x,b,c,d};
	In> lst;
	Result: {a,x,b,c,d};
