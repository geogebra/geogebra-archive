*CMD Clear --- undo an assignment
*CORE
*CALL
	Clear(var, ...)

*PARMS

{var} -- name of variable to be cleared

*DESC

All assignments made to the variables listed as arguments are
undone. From now on, all these variables remain unevaluated (until a
subsequent assignment is made). Also clears any metadata that may have
been set in an unbound variable.  The result of the expression is
True.

*E.G.

	In> a := 5;
	Out> 5;
	In> a^2;
	Out> 25;

	In> Clear(a);
	Out> True;
	In> a^2;
	Out> a^2;

/*

*CMD MacroClear --- define rules in functions
*CORE
*DESC

This function has the same effect as its non-macro counterpart, except
that its arguments are evaluated before the required action is performed.
This is useful in macro-like procedures or in functions that need to define new
rules based on parameters.

Make sure that the arguments of {Macro}... commands evaluate to expressions that would normally be used in the non-macro version!
