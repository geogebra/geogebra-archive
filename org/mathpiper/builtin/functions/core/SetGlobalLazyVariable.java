*CMD SetGlobalLazyVariable --- global variable is to be evaluated lazily
*CORE
*CALL
	SetGlobalLazyVariable(var,value)

*PARMS

{var} -- variable (held argument)

{value} -- value to be set to (evaluated before it is assigned)

*DESC

{SetGlobalLazyVariable} enforces that a global variable will re-evaluate
when used. This functionality doesn't survive if {Unbind(var)}
is called afterwards.

Places where this is used include the global variables {%} and {I}.

The use of lazy in the name stems from the concept of lazy evaluation.
The object the global variable is bound to will only be evaluated when
called. The {SetGlobalLazyVariable} property only holds once: after
that, the result of evaluation is stored in the global variable, and it won't be reevaluated again:

	In> SetGlobalLazyVariable(a,Hold(Taylor(x,0,30)Sin(x)))
	Out> True

Then the first time you call {a} it evaluates {Taylor(...)} and assigns the result to {a}. The next time
you call {a} it immediately returns the result.
{SetGlobalLazyVariable} is called for {%} each time {%} changes.

The following example demonstrates the sequence of execution:

	In> SetGlobalLazyVariable(test,Hold(Write("hello")))
	Out> True

The text "hello" is not written out to screen yet. However, evaluating
the variable {test} forces the expression to be evaluated:

	In> test
	"hello"Out> True

*E.G.

	In> Set(a,Hold(2+3))
	Out> True
	In> a
	Out> 2+3
	In> SetGlobalLazyVariable(a,Hold(2+3))
	Out> True
	In> a
	Out> 5
