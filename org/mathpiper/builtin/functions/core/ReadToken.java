*CMD ReadToken --- read a token from current input
*CORE
*CALL
	ReadToken()

*DESC

Read a token from the current input, and return it unevaluated.
The returned object is a MathPiper atom (not a string).
When
the end of an input file is encountered, the token atom {EndOfFile} is returned.

A token is for computer languages what a word is for human languages:
it is the smallest unit in which a command can be divided, so that the
semantics (that is the meaning) of the command is in some sense a
combination of the semantics of the tokens. Hence {a := foo} consists of three tokens, namely {a}, {:=}, and {foo}.

The parsing of the string depends on the syntax of the language.
The part of the kernel that does the parsing is the "tokenizer".
MathPiper can parse its own syntax (the default tokenizer) or it can be instructed to parse XML or C++ syntax using the directives {DefaultTokenizer} or {XmlTokenizer}.
Setting a tokenizer is a global action that affects all {ReadToken} calls.

*E.G. notest

	In> PipeFromString("a := Sin(x)") While \
	  ((tok := ReadToken()) != EndOfFile) \
	  Echo(tok);
	a
	:=
	Sin
	(
	x
	)
	Result: True;

We can read some junk too:
	In> PipeFromString("-$3")ReadToken();
	Result: -$;
The result is an atom with the string representation {-$}.
MathPiper assumes that {-$} is an operator symbol yet to be defined.
The "{3}" will be in the next token.
(The results will be different if a non-default tokenizer is selected.)
