*CMD FlatCopy --- copy the top level of a list

*CALL
	FlatCopy(list)

*PARMS

{list} -- list to be copied

*DESC

A copy of "list" is made and returned. The list is not recursed
into, only the car level is copied. This is useful in combination
with the destructive commands that actually modify lists in place (for
efficiency).

*E.G.

The following shows a possible way to define a command that reverses a
list nondestructively.

	In> reverse(l_IsList) <-- DestructiveReverse \
	  (FlatCopy(l));
	Result: True;
	In> lst := {a,b,c,d,e};
	Result: {a,b,c,d,e};
	In> reverse(lst);
	Result: {e,d,c,b,a};
	In> lst;
	Result: {a,b,c,d,e};
