*CMD LispRead --- read expressions in LISP syntax
*CORE
*CALL
	LispRead()

*DESC

The function {LispRead} reads an expression in the LISP syntax from the current input, and returns
it unevaluated. When the end of an input file is encountered, the
special token atom {EndOfFile} is returned.

The MathPiper expression {a+b} is written in the LISP syntax as {(+ a b)}. The advantage of this syntax is that it is
less ambiguous than the infix operator grammar that MathPiper uses by
default.

*E.G. notest

	In> FromString("(+ a b)") LispRead();
	Out> a+b;
	In> FromString("(List (Sin x) (- (Cos x)))") \
	  LispRead();
	Out> {Sin(x),-Cos(x)};
	In> FromString("(+ a b)")LispRead()
	Out> a+b;
