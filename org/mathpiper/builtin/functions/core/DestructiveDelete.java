*CMD DestructiveDelete --- delete an element destructively from a list
*CORE
*CALL
	DestructiveDelete(list, n)

*PARMS

{list} -- list from which an element should be removed

{n} -- index of the element to remove

*DESC

This is the destructive counterpart of {Delete}. This
command yields the same result as the corresponding call to
{Delete}, but the original list is modified. So if a
variable is bound to "list", it will now be bound to the list with
the n-th entry removed.

Destructive commands run faster than their nondestructive counterparts
because the latter copy the list before they alter it.

*E.G.

	In> lst := {a,b,c,d,e,f};
	Result: {a,b,c,d,e,f};
	In> Delete(lst, 4);
	Result: {a,b,c,e,f};
	In> lst;
	Result: {a,b,c,d,e,f};
	In> DestructiveDelete(lst, 4);
	Result: {a,b,c,e,f};
	In> lst;
	Result: {a,b,c,e,f};
