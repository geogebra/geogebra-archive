*CMD Postfix --- define function syntax (postfix operator)
*CORE
*CALL
	Postfix("op")
	Postfix("op", precedence)

*PARMS

{"op"} -- string, the name of a function

{precedence} -- nonnegative integer (evaluated)

*DESC

Declares a special syntax for the function to be parsed as a bodied, infix, postfix,
or prefix operator.

"Postfix" functions must have one argument and are syntactically placed after their argument.

Function name can be any string but meaningful usage and readability would
require it to be either made up entirely of letters or entirely of non-letter
characters (such as "+", ":" etc.).
Precedence is optional (will be set to 0 by default).

*E.G.
	In> todo
