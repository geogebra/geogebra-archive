*CMD MacroRule --- define rules in functions
*CORE
*DESC

This function has the same effect as its non-macro counterpart, except
that its arguments are evaluated before the required action is performed.
This is useful in macro-like procedures or in functions that need to define new
rules based on parameters.

Make sure that the arguments of {Macro}... commands evaluate to expressions that would normally be used in the non-macro version!
