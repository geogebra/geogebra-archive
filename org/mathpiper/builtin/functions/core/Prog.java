*CMD Prog --- block of statements
*CORE
*CALL
	Prog(statement1, statement2, ...)

*PARMS

{statement1}, {statement2} -- expressions

*DESC

The {Prog} and the {[ ... ]} construct have the same effect: they evaluate all
arguments in order and return the result of the last evaluated expression.

{Prog(a,b);} is the same as typing {[a;b;];} and is very useful for writing out
function bodies. The {[ ... ]} construct is a syntactically nicer version of the
{Prog} call; it is converted into {Prog(...)} during the parsing stage.
