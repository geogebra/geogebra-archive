*CMD Infix --- define function syntax (infix operator)
*CORE
*CALL
	Infix("op")
	Infix("op", precedence)

*PARMS

{"op"} -- string, the name of a function

{precedence} -- nonnegative integer (evaluated)

*DESC

Declares a special syntax for the function to be parsed as an  infix operator.

"Infix" functions must have two arguments and are syntactically placed between their arguments.
Names of infix functions can be arbitrary, although for reasons of readability they are usually made of non-alphabetic characters.

Function name can be any string but meaningful usage and readability would
require it to be either made up entirely of letters or entirely of non-letter
characters (such as "+", ":" etc.).
Precedence is optional (will be set to 0 by default).

*E.G.
	In> Infix("##", 5)
	Result: True;
	In> a ## b ## c
	Result: a##b##c;
