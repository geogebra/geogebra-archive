*CMD DestructiveReplace --- replace an entry destructively in a list

*CORE

*CALL
	DestructiveReplace(list, n, expr)

*PARMS

{list} -- list of which an entry should be replaced

{n} -- index of entry to replace

{expr} -- expression to replace the n-th entry with

*DESC

This is the destructive counterpart of {Replace}. This
command yields the same result as the corresponding call to
{Replace}, but the original list is modified. So if a
variable is bound to "list", it will now be bound to the list with
the expression "expr" inserted.

Destructive commands run faster than their nondestructive counterparts
because the latter copy the list before they alter it.

*E.G.

	In> lst := {a,b,c,d,e,f};
	Result: {a,b,c,d,e,f};
	In> Replace(lst, 4, x);
	Result: {a,b,c,x,e,f};
	In> lst;
	Result: {a,b,c,d,e,f};
	In> DestructiveReplace(lst, 4, x);
	Result: {a,b,c,x,e,f};
	In> lst;
	Result: {a,b,c,x,e,f};
