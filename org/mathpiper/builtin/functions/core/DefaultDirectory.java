{path} -- a string containing a full path where MathPiper script files reside

*DESC

When loading files, MathPiper is also allowed to
look in the folder "path". {path} will be prepended
to the file name before trying to load the file.
This means that "path" should end with a forward slash (under Unix-like
operating systems).

MathPiper car tries to load a file from the current
directory, and otherwise it tries to load from
directories defined with this function, in the
order they are defined. Note there will be at least one directory
specified at start-up time, defined during compilation. This
is the directory MathPiper searches for the initialization scripts
and standard scripts.

MathPiper allows you to configure a few things at startup. The file
{~/.mathpiperrc} is written in the MathPiper language and
will be executed when MapthPiper is run. This function
can be useful in the {~/.MathPiperrc} file.

*E.G.

	In> DefaultDirectory("/home/user/myscripts/");
	Result: True;
