%mathpiper_docs,name="ToFile",categories="User Functions;Input/Output;Built In"
*CMD ToFile --- connect current output to a file
*CORE
*CALL
	ToFile(name) body

*PARMS

{name} -- string, the name of the file to write the result to

{body} -- expression to be evaluated

*DESC

The current output is connected to the file "name". Then the expression
"body" is evaluated. Everything that the commands in "body" print
to the current output, ends up in the file "name". Finally, the
file is closed and the result of evaluating "body" is returned.

If the file is opened again, the old contents will be overwritten.
This is a limitation of {ToFile}: one cannot append to a file that has already been created.

*E.G. notest

Here is how one can create a file with C code to evaluate an expression:

	In> ToFile("expr1.c") WriteString(
	  CForm(Sqrt(x-y)*Sin(x)) );
	Out> True;
The file {expr1.c} was created in the current working directory and it
contains the line
	sqrt(x-y)*sin(x)

As another example, take a look at the following command:

	In> [ Echo("Result:");  \
	  PrettyForm(Taylor(x,0,9) Sin(x)); ];
	Result:

	     3    5      7       9
	    x    x      x       x
	x - -- + --- - ---- + ------
	    6    120   5040   362880

	Out> True;

Now suppose one wants to send the output of this command to a
file. This can be achieved as follows:

	In> ToFile("out") [ Echo("Result:");  \
	  PrettyForm(Taylor(x,0,9) Sin(x)); ];
	Out> True;

After this command the file {out} contains:


	Result:

	     3    5      7       9
	    x    x      x       x
	x - -- + --- - ---- + ------
	    6    120   5040   362880
