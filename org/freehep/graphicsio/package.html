I/O for different graphics in and output formats.
<p>The classes in this package form a base for use in different output formats.</p>
<p>You need to properly nest calls to &quot;create()&quot; and
&quot;dispose()&quot; to allow the different output formats to have their
graphics states stored and restored. All swing components do this.</p>
