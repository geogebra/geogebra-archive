/**
 * This interface allows the implementing component to interact with a
 * StackedPanel.  The StackedPanel handles all of the details of
 * layering, repainting, etc.; however, it cannot provide the actual
 * content to display.  This is the responsibility of the
 * PanelArtist. 
 * 
 * If the content changes then the PanelArtist is expected to signal
 * to the StackedPanel that a redraw is needed (redrawNeeded method of
 * StackedPanel).  The StackedPanel will then callback the PanelArtist
 * via the drawPanel method.  The PanelArtist is then responsible for
 * deciding what needs to be drawn.  The actual drawing can be done in
 * a background thread if desired. 
 *
 * This interface allows only one StackedPanel to be controlled by a
 * given PanelArtist.  Consequently, when the setPanelArtist method is
 * called the component should save the value.
