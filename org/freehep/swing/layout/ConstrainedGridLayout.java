/** 
 * The <code>ConstrainedGridLayout</code> layout manager is based on
 * the <code>GraphPaperLayout</code> layout manager written by Michael
 * Martak. 
 *
 * This layout manager divides the container into a set of equally
 * sized cells arranged in a grid which has <code>nw</code> cells
 * in the horizontal direction and <code>nh</code> cells in the
 * vertical direction.  Components can occupy an rectangular subset of
 * these cells; the component's position and size are based on given
 * rectangular constraints.
 * 
 * This extends the functionality of the <code>GraphPaperLayout</code>
 * manager by also constraining the overall aspect ratio of the
 * container.   It will also force a containing window to resize if
 * the desired size of the container isn't a size which is allowed by
 * the contraints.  A byproduct of this is that the preferred sizes of
 * components controlled by this layout manager will be reset to the
 * largest allowed size which is smaller than the current size.
 *
 * Components can overlap making this layout manager a good choice for
 * a <code>JLayeredPane</code>.  To allow the standard moveToFront and
 * moveToBack methods to work as expected, the constraints of a
 * removed component are retained so that if it is later added again
 * without contraints the layout manager will still arrange the
 * components reasonably.  (The standard moveToFront implementation,
 * removes a component and re-adds it without taking into account the
 * possible constraints.)
