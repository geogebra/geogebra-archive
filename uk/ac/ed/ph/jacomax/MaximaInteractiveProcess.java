/**
 * Handle on an "interactive" Maxima process, as created using
 * {@link MaximaProcessLauncher#launchInteractiveProcess()}.
 * <p>
 * Use this if you want to send a series of commands (or calls) to Maxima
 * for it to evaluate and (possibly) return results.
 * <p>
 * Call {@link #terminate()} to terminate and clean up
 * the Maxima process once you have finished using it. Any further calls
 * made will result in a {@link MaximaProcessTerminatedException} being thrown.
 * <p>
 * Calls are executed with a timeout (specified in seconds), which can be passed
 * explicitly of defaulted in various ways. If the timeout is greater than zero and
 * the call has not completed in the allotted time, the underlying Maxima process is
 * terminated and a {@link MaximaTimeoutException} is thrown. Any further calls made
 * will generate a {@link MaximaProcessTerminatedException}. If the timeout is zero
 * or less, then calls are allowed to run indefinitely. (This should be used
 * with caution!)
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class should only be used by one thread at a time.
