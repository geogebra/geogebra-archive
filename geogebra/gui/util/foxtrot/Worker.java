/**
 * The class that execute time-consuming {@link Task}s and {@link Job}s. <br />
 * It is normally used in event listeners that must execute time-consuming operations without
 * freezing the Swing GUI. <br />
 * Usage example (simplified from the Foxtrot examples):
 * <pre>
 * JButton button = new JButton("Take a nap!");
 * button.addActionListener(new ActionListener()
 * {
 *    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
 *    {
 *       try
 *       {
 *          Worker.post(new Task()
 *          {
 *             public Object run() throws Exception
 *             {
 *                 Thread.sleep(10000);
 *                 return null;
 *             }
 *          });
 *       }
 *       catch (Exception ignored) {}
 *    }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * While normally not necessary, it is possible to customize the two core components of this
 * class, the {@link EventPump} and the {@link WorkerThread} via the corrispondent setter
 * methods. <br />
 * This class uses by default a WorkerThread that enqueues Tasks; Tasks will be executed one
 * after the other. This is the behavior needed by most applications that want to rely on a
 * synchronous model. For an alternative behavior, see {@link ConcurrentWorker}
 *
 * @version $Revision: 1.2 $
