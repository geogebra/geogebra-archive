This directory contains 3rd party libraries. Most of them are required
to build GeoGebra properly.

lib_jsobject.jar
----------------

Its original content comes from the official Java JDK distribution
provided by Sun Microsystems, Inc. The contents of this file are copied
from lib/jre/plugin.jar. To make this JAR file small, just the needed
.class files are present.

The license for this piece of software is Sun Microsystem, Inc. Binary

can be downloaded from http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp?locale=en.

lib_mac_extensions.jar
----------------------

Its original content comes from the official Java JDK distribution
provided by Apple, Inc., for the Mac OS X. The contents of this file are
copied from Classes/ui.jar. To make this JAR file small, just the needed
.class files were selected.

Here is an except from http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/:

    Q: Can I bundle the Mac OS X JDK with my application?

    A: Java is included as part of Mac OS X, and is not available for
    re-distribution by 3rd-party developers. 

However, this does not mean that it is forbidden to re-distribute any
parts of the Java JDK for Mac, it still means that there is no direct
way to download JDK for the Mac OS X from the Internet officially. For
convenience we still copied those parts of it which are required to
compile GeoGebra properly. Anyone who has a legal Apple computer
with legal software can use the Java JDK on his machine without
no further permissions. For those developers we give a convenient way
to set up the underlying libraries by providing lib_mac_extensions.jar.
