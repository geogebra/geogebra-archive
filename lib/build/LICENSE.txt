lib_p200ant_java5only.jar
-------------------------

A modified version of Matthias Mann's Pack200 ANT task software
(http://www.matthiasmann.de/content/view/20/26/). The original version
can be downloaded here:

http://www.matthiasmann.de/java/p200ant.tgz

The only modification was to filter out those systems which run
Java 1.6 or above:

    if (!System.getProperty("java.version").startsWith("1.5"))
	throw new BuildException("Must be run under Java 1.5");

It was necessary to workaround this bug:
