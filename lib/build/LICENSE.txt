This directory contains 3rd party libraries. Most of them are required
to build GeoGebra properly.


ecj
---

The EDT Core Batch Compiler (also known as Eclipse Java Compiler) is
used for command line builds. This is the same software as the built-in
Java compiler in Eclipse. Sometimes some mirror servers are down,
so it is required for us to give a fallback download for ecj.

javacc
------

This library can be downloaded both from java.net, but for faster
availability we also host it in the GeoGebra repository as well.

License: BSD License.


jogl1
-----

The original binaries are repackaged into .zip files in order to
decrease download time.

License: BSD License.


jogl2
-----

The original binaries are repackaged into .zip files for a shorter
download time. The original files are here:

lib_jsobject.jar
----------------

Its original content comes from the official Java JDK distribution
provided by Sun Microsystems, Inc. The contents of this file are copied
from lib/jre/plugin.jar. To make this JAR file small, just the needed
.class files are present.

The license for this piece of software is Sun Microsystem, Inc. Binary
Code License Agreement (BCL), 
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/jre-6u2-license.txt. The original packages
can be downloaded from http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp?locale=en.


lib_mac_extensions.jar
----------------------

Its original content comes from the official Java JDK distribution
provided by Apple, Inc., for the Mac OS X. The contents of this file are
copied from Classes/ui.jar. To make this JAR file small, just the needed
.class files were selected.

Here is an excerpt from http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/:

    Q: Can I bundle the Mac OS X JDK with my application?

    A: Java is included as part of Mac OS X, and is not available for
    re-distribution by 3rd-party developers. 

However, this does not mean that it is forbidden to re-distribute any
parts of the Java JDK for Mac, it still means that there is no direct
way to download JDK for the Mac OS X from the Internet officially. For
convenience we still copied those parts of it which are required to
compile GeoGebra properly. Anyone who has a legal Apple computer
with legal software can use the Java JDK on his machine without
no further permissions. For those developers we give a convenient way
to set up the underlying libraries by providing lib_mac_extensions.jar.


tools_p200ant_java5only.jar
---------------------------

A modified version of Matthias Mann's Pack200 ANT task software
(http://www.matthiasmann.de/content/view/20/26/). The original version
can be downloaded here:

http://www.matthiasmann.de/java/p200ant.tgz

The only modification was to filter out those systems which run
Java 1.6 or above:

    if (!System.getProperty("java.version").startsWith("1.5"))
	throw new BuildException("Must be run under Java 1.5");

It was necessary to workaround this bug:
