GeoGebra for Unix-like operating systems
----------------------------------------

GeoGebra is a free dynamic mathematics software. Please visit
http://www.geogebra.org to learn more about it.

This package contains the binary distribution of GeoGebra for Unix-like
operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and similar ones). We cannot
provide the source code in a tarball currently, instead please refer to
the GeoGebra Subversion repository (http://www.geogebra.org/svn/) for
all required files and the GeoGebra Trac for documentation
(http://www.geogebra.org/trac) on compiling GeoGebra from the source
code.

To run GeoGebra on a Unix-like system, please run the "geogebra" script.
Make sure that you already have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
installed first, and its "java" executable is on the system path.

To install GeoGebra on a Unix-like system, please run "install.sh". You
may need administrator privileges for that.

To uninstall GeoGebra, please run "uninstall.sh". You may need
admininstrator privileges.

Please make sure that you read the _LICENSE.txt file for details of
commercial and non-commercial use of GeoGebra.
