These files are for automated server-side builds using Subversion via HTTP.

Usage:

1. Copy autobuild.conf.dist to autobuild.conf and edit as needed.

2. Run ./checkout to create a working copy of the repository (this step
   is needed only once, but probably it is already done --- if yes,
   make sure that all relevant steps are run from that script).

3. Run ./update every time you want to generate a fresh build.

4. (Optional.) Create a cronjob (using 'crontab -e') to periodically
   create a build (currently not suggested). Make sure you are 'cd'ing
   to this directory before running ./update.
   Currently the cronjob is the following:

   */15 * * * * cd /Users/zoltan/svn/geogebra/scripts/autobuild; ./update 2>&1 \
    >/tmp/autobuild.log && cp /tmp/autobuild.log /Users/zoltan/webstart/test40a
