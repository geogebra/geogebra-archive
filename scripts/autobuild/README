These files are for automated server-side builds using Subversion via HTTP
(or the local file system).

Usage:

1. Copy autobuild.conf.dist to autobuild.conf and edit the latter as needed.

2. Run ./checkout to create a working copy of the repository (this step
   is needed only once, but probably it is already done --- if no,
   make sure that all relevant steps are run from that script). On demand
   another run can be done, it is harmless to do it again later.

3. Run ./buildggb42 or ./deployggb42 to create a fresh numbered
   version build into the test42 or 4.2 directory, respectively.
