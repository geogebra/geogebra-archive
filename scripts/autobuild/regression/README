Regression tests
----------------

This test suite is created for automatizing intensive testing for
GeoGebra. First the stable-jars/ and devel-jars/ directories
must be created and the 3.2 GeoGebra JARs should be put to
stable-jars/ and the development version (to be tested) to
devel-jars.

To run all tests, just enter

  ./runtests

This should run all *.ggb files and compare their output with the
pregenerated *.out files, respectively.

If you want to create a new test, just copy the file somewhere in the
tests/ folder with .ggb extension. The output for this test can be
generated using

  ./makeregr tests/subpath/testname.ggb

This will create the file tests/subpath/testname.out.

The script "runtests" calls the script "runtest" as many times as many
*.ggb files exist in the tests/ folder. If there is some difference
between the pregenerated and the currently created output, then a .diff
file is put down in the tmp/ directory. Outputs for errors are shown the
same place in *.err files. You might want to use the

  ./showdiffs

command to view all differences.

This regression test subsystem is borrowed from the formconv utility.
See http://formconv.sf.net for details.
