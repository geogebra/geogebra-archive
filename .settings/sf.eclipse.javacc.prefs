# The external JavaCC is not really needed here.
# From Eclipse we usually don't use the external
# JavaCC JAR file, only the plugin version.
# By contrast, on command line build the external javacc.jar is used from
# ../lib/build/javacc/javacc.jar, but it is completely different from the
# Eclipse plugin, thus here we don't use it. Of course, we can still
# use the external version for the Eclipse build as well if someone starts
# the appropriate target from ../build.xml --- but why to do so? ;-)
